The Jeep Compass is a compact crossover SUV[3][4] introduced for the 2007 model year,[5] and is currently in its second generation. The first generation Compass and Patriot, its rebadged variant, were among Jeep's first crossover SUVs. The second-generation Compass debuted in September 2016 in Brazil and at the Los Angeles International Auto Show in November 2016, sharing a modified platform with the Renegade. It is positioned between the smaller Renegade and the larger Cherokee globally or the Commander in South America.

Concept
Four years prior to the introduction of the production Jeep Compass, a concept vehicle with the same name had its world premiere in Detroit at the 2002 North American International Auto Show. It featured a two-door body, all-wheel drive and a 3.7-liter V6 engine.[6]

The 3.7 L Power-Tech V6 engine from the Jeep Liberty was not available in the new Compass for 2007, though the production model Compass kept the concept car's styling cues and some of its features. The production model Compass also had four doors instead of the two doors on the concept car.
